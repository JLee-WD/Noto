# Noto

#### Noto is a note-taking app built using JavaScript, React and Ruby on Rails developed by [Justin Lee](https://github.com/JLee-WD) and [Richard Cho](https://github.com/Ryuukishi/).



## Problem

Do you think we need to state the problem separately?

- Students sometimes have trouble understanding reference websites online. If it is something they have learnt already they may not have written it down, or their written notes may be an unorganized mess.
- A class will always have students who dont understand the content the same way others do. Collaboration and note taking solves this.
- Googling something you once knew a long time ago may not provide the best result. Especially if it is a piece of code you used previously.

## Purpose

- Noto aims to make it easier for you to write notes and organise all your ideas in one place.
- No need for cheatsheets or long, unsorted google docs.
- Organize your notes in more ways than one.
- Designed for programming students and professionals.
- Share and collaborate with your peers during class.
- Somewhere inbetween a reference website like MDN, and google docs.

## Functionality

- **Toggle visibility** - Noto lets you choose whether to keep your notes private or public. Public notes can be viewed by anyone and it makes it easy for you to share a piece of code or snippet of text with someone else.
- **Share your notes** - Share your notes in a list with a friend in the same class. Instead of writing your notes in an endless google doc, Noto lets you collaborate with your cohort by inviting your peers to a group to write and share notes. 
- **Concise bite-sized notes** - write notes during on an easy-to-use interface quickly and securely. Noto is specially designed for software engineering students, with custom input fields specifically for code.
- **Examples** - Noto lets you save coding examples that you have used before. Save quick-reference design patterns that you have used in practice before.
- **Reference Photos/Images** - Dont have time to write down everything? Or have you found a diagram that explains the concept better than words? Take a photo, or save an image and attach it to the note.
- **Sort and Filter** - Noto has a suite of convenient sort and filtering functions, allowing quick access to the notes you need. As default, the notes are stored chronologically with the latest notes first.
- **Search** - The search bar lets you search for key words in the notes.
- **Group notes** - Notes can be grouped together (?)
- **Syntax highlighting** - Noto supports syntax highlighting along with customizable styles and a wide range of themes to beautify your code. 
- **Export notes** - Notes can be exported and saved locally for offline access.

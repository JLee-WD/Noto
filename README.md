# Noto/memori/memento?

#### ... is a note-taking app built using JavaScript, React and Ruby on Rails developed by [Justin Lee](https://github.com/JLee-WD) and [Richard Cho](https://github.com/Ryuukishi/).

## Problem

Do you think we need to state the problem separately?

## Purpose

- Noto aims to make it easier for you to write notes and organise all your ideas in one place.
- No need for cheatsheets or long, unsorted google docs.
- Organize your notes in more ways than one.
- Designed for programming students and professionals.
- Share and collaborate with your peers during class.

## Functionality

- **Toggle visibility** - Noto lets you choose whether to keep your notes private or public. Public notes can be viewed by anyone and it makes it easy for you to share a piece of code or snippet with someone else.
- **Share your notes** - (Don't know how to achieve this...) share your notes in a list with a friend in the same class. Instead of writing your notes in an endless google doc, Noto lets you collaborate with your cohort by inviting your peers to a group to write and share notes.
- **Concise bite-sized notes** - write notes during on an easy-to-use interface quickly and securely. Noto is specially designed for software engineering students, with custom input fields specifically for code.
- **Sort and Filter** - Noto has a suite of convenient sort and filtering functions, allowing quick access to the notes you need. As default, the notes are stored chronologically with the latest notes first.
- **Search** - The search bar lets you search for key words in the notes.
- **Group notes** - Notes can be grouped together (?)
